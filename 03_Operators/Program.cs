//Arithmetic operators perform operations with numeric operands

// addition (+)
//Example: backAccount +12

//subtraction (-)
//ex: rations -1

//multiplication (*)
//ex: total * taxPercentage

//division (/)
//ex: markers /studenCount
//This gets how many times the value held by 'markers' can be divided into the value held
//by the variable student count

//remainder operator (%, known as modulus)
//ex: 10 %3, would return 1 (the remainder left over)
//determines even and odd values

//Unary Operators
//ex: increment++ count up by one, decrement-- remove by one

//Assume that studentCount holds a value of 30
int studenCount =30;
//add one to studentCount
// studenCount+=1; we can do it this way also
studenCount++;

//Decrement 'studentCount' by 1
// studenCount-= 1; we can also do it this way
studenCount--;

//More examples:

int additionResult = 5+2;
System.Console.WriteLine("5+2 = " + additionResult);

//subtraction
int subtractionResult = 5-2;
System.Console.WriteLine("5-2 = " + subtractionResult);

//multiplication
int mutiplicationResult = 5*2;
System.Console.WriteLine("5*2 = " + mutiplicationResult);

//division
int divisionResult = 5/2;
System.Console.WriteLine("5/2 = " + divisionResult);

//Modulus
System.Console.WriteLine(10%2);

System.Console.WriteLine(10%9);

System.Console.WriteLine(16%3);

System.Console.WriteLine(19%5);
